## Guessing Game Diagram  
This diagram shows how a guessing game *could* function.  
#### How would it work?  
In this game, the computer would generate a random number between 1 and 100, and then the user would be prompted to guess repeatedly until they can figure out the computer's number. If the user inputs a number between 1 and 100, then the computer would check if the input number is equal to the computer's number. If not, then the computer would check whether the input number was higher or lower than the computer's number, and tell the user to guess lower or higher, respectively.  
#### What if the user's input is invalid?  
If the user inputs a number *outside* the range of 1 to 100, then the computer would prompt the user to guess again. If the the user were to input an invalid character, like a letter, then the computer would also prompt the user to guess again.
