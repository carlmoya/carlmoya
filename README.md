# About Me
## My Interests
  I like to watch movies. My favorite movie right now is *Wall-E*, and it's **awesome!** I would recommend it to anyone, including the person reading this right now. I also like to play video games. My favorite game right now is *The Last of Us Part II* because of how **awesome** it is. Eating food is another pastime of mine, with my favorite food being pizza. I don't think I could accurately capture how **awesome** pizza is with just words, so you'll just have to believe me when I say that it is. Soda is also *pretty* good. But besides those things I mostly just do school work or lounge about.
## Websites I Recommend
  [Staggering Beauty](http://www.staggeringbeauty.com/) - This is an **awesome** website to visit when you are bored. On the website you can control a worm and cause all *kinds* of crazy visuals to appear onscreen, but it should be said that it may not be safe for everyone to use due to the flashing images.
  [Fried Chicken Simulator](https://friedchickensimulator.surge.sh/) - This is another **awesome** website I like to visit every now and then. The premise is very basic, but I enjoy using it nonetheless. On this website, you can spawn drumsticks of chicken by clicking with your mouse. The website is poorly optimized, so I like to try to spawn as many as I can and cause my computer to slow down.
    [EasyBib](https://www.easybib.com/) - This is a *very* useful website that I use for citing sources when I need to, typically for academic work. It is a tool that you can use to create citations for many different types of sources like books and movies.
